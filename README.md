# Chat UI

A chat interface using open source models, eg OpenAssistant.

## Launch

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Environment

Default configuration is in `.env`. Put custom config and secrets in `.env.local`, it will override the values in `.env`.

Check out [.env](./.env) to see what needs to be set.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
